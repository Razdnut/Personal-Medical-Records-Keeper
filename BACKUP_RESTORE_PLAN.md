# Medical Records Backup & Restore System - Progressive Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a progressive implementation approach for adding backup and restore functionality to the Medical Records Management System. The plan starts with basic manual backup capabilities and evolves into a comprehensive automated backup and disaster recovery solution.

## Implementation Philosophy

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic manual backup/restore functionality
- **Incremental Build**: Add features in small, testable increments
- **User Feedback**: Validate each phase before proceeding
- **Safety First**: Prioritize data integrity and recovery validation
- **Leverage Existing**: Build upon current export/import infrastructure

## Getting Started

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Review Current Export System**: Understand existing export_service.py
2. **Create Development Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/backup-restore-phase1`
3. **Set Up Development Environment**: Ensure PostgreSQL tools available
4. **Create Basic Directory Structure**: `/backups` directory
5. **Start with Database Model**: Add BackupRecord to models.py

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Ensure PostgreSQL client tools are available
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install postgresql                  # macOS

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p backups
chmod 750 backups

# Test database connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"
```

This progressive approach ensures that each phase delivers working functionality while building toward a comprehensive backup and restore solution. Each phase can be thoroughly tested and validated before moving to the next level of complexity.
